## :thinking: Why Use it? 

Because it is possible to make a better calculator than Apple. :stuck_out_tongue:

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the first lab of the course ECE 5010 Software Design. This lab was done in the first week of class in my 5th term as a computer engineering student at Memorial University of Newfoundland. This lab uses basic object oriented programming concepts in Java to make a simple calculator. The IDE that was used was Eclipse and I suggest that you use Eclipse as well to pull this project down. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Eclipse for your IDE
You will also need the latest JAVA JDK

### Installing

It's important that you first install Java before Eclipse.  

```
Step 1: Install the latest Java JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads)
```

```
Step 2: Install Eclipse from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads)
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once Eclipse and Java are installed. Open the project in your Eclipse workspace and run the View.java file. You should see the calculator pop up.
