## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is the first lab of the course ECE 5010 Software Design. This lab was done in the first week of class in my 5th term as a computer engineering student. This lab uses basic object oriented programming concepts in Java to make a simple calculator. The IDE that was used was Eclipse and I suggest that you use Eclipse as well to pull this project down. 

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Eclipse for your IDE
You will also need the latest JAVA JDK

### Installing

It's important that you first install Java before Eclipse.  

```
Step 1: Install the latest Java JDK from here. (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
```

```
Step 2: Install Eclipse from here.( https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once Eclipse and Java are installed. Open the project in Eclipse and Run the project. You should see the calculator pop up.
